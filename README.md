# ChefSalad


1) A Prototype inspired from Overcoocked where you have to serve the customer with their required order.
2) Food items are denoted as alphabets. A combination of ABC will have food items of A, B and C. 
3) Every customer will have a timer, so delay in placing the order will make the customer angry and player will loose points.
4) Early order placing will reward the player with bonus points. 


Please check the gameplay video in the repo for a detailed view of the game :)
