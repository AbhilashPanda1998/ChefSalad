# ChefSalad


1) A Prototype inspired from Overcoocked where you have to serve the customer with their required order.
2) Food items are denoted as alphabets. So a combination of ABC will have food items of A, B and C. 
3) Every customer will have a timer, so delay in placing the order will make the customer and angry and player will loose points.
